BidWars Project Review & Rebuild Plan (Solo Developer)
======================================================

Approach: Kanban workflow with weekly Scrum-style reviews

------------------------------------------------------
1. Project Review Plan
------------------------------------------------------

A. Set Up Kanban Board
   - Columns: Backlog | To Do | In Progress | Testing | Done
   - Tool: Trello, GitHub Projects, Notion, or sticky notes

B. Code & Feature Audit
   - Review all controllers, models, routes
   - Document:
     - Each file/module’s purpose
     - Unclear or duplicate logic
     - Outdated dependencies/patterns
     - Security issues (e.g., error handling, file uploads)
   - Create Kanban cards for:
     - Bugs
     - Technical debt (unclear code, missing error handling)
     - Missing/outdated documentation
     - Features to improve or refactor

C. Testing & Manual QA
   - List all endpoints/features
   - Test each manually (Postman or similar)
   - Note failures, confusing responses, missing validation
   - Add these as cards to Kanban board

D. Prioritize
   - Move most critical issues (security, bugs, core features) to top of To Do

------------------------------------------------------
2. Re-Build Plan (Kanban + Scrum Elements)
------------------------------------------------------

A. Kanban for Workflow
   - Continuous flow: 1–2 tasks In Progress at a time (WIP limit)
   - Move cards as you work: Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Testing → Done

B. Scrum Elements for Structure
   - Weekly Review: End of week, review Done, stuck tasks, improvements (mini-retrospective)
   - Planning: Start of week, pick top cards from Backlog to To Do

C. Re-Build Steps

   1. Set Up Modern Tooling
      - Update dependencies (Node, Express, etc.)
      - Set up ESLint/Prettier for code style
      - Add README with setup instructions

   2. Refactor & Modularize
      - Refactor controllers for clarity and error handling
      - Modularize code (separate concerns, use services/helpers)

   3. Improve Error Handling & Validation
      - Use proper status codes (400 for bad request, 201 for created, 500 for server error, etc.)
      - Validate all inputs (e.g., check for missing files or IDs)

   4. Testing
      - Add unit tests for controllers/models (Jest or Mocha)
      - Add integration tests for API endpoints

   5. Documentation
      - Document all endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI or Markdown)
      - Update README with usage and contribution guidelines

   6. Security & Best Practices
      - Sanitize file uploads
      - Handle errors gracefully
      - Secure sensitive data

   7. Deployment
      - Prepare for deployment (Docker, env variables, etc.)
      - Test in a staging environment

------------------------------------------------------
3. Example Kanban Board

| Backlog                | To Do                | In Progress         | Testing            | Done               |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Refactor error codes   | Update README        | Refactor create API | Test create API    | Fix upload bug     |
| Add input validation   | Add unit tests       |                     |                    |                    |
| Document endpoints     |                      |                     |                    |                    |

------------------------------------------------------
4. Weekly Cycle Example

- Monday: Move top 2–3 cards to To Do
- Daily: Work on 1–2 cards at a time, move to Testing when ready
- Friday: Review Done, reflect on what went well, update backlog

------------------------------------------------------
5. Why Kanban?

- Flexible, visual, and easy to adapt priorities
- Scrum-style weekly reviews add structure and improvement
- Ideal for solo developers modernizing and improving a project

------------------------------------------------------
Summary

Use Kanban for daily workflow and add Scrum-style weekly reviews for structure and improvement. This gives you flexibility, focus, and regular checkpoints—ideal for a solo developer modernizing
